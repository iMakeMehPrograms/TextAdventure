This is an old thing I made a while ago. It's spaghetti Java code (yay, my favorite) and a .sh build script. Also some .txts for showing art and such.
However, I do have a soft spot in my heart for it, as it is the first game I made even if it is a horrible coding nightmare. It took around 1-3ish months 
to make as I was an inexperienced programmer (hence the spaghetti code). I am currently making a sequel to this game in C++ however I've not been working 
on it too much. So, if for whatever reason you are waiting for the sequel of this nightmare that is hopefully less of a nightmare don't expect it soon. 
Also if you want to modify it go ahead just credit me.
