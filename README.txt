 + is a intersection of rooms
 | and - are walls
 : is an exit
 M is a enemy
 P is the spawnpoint
 G is the goal
 C is a chest

 This is the plan:

 Phase 1:

 Map:
 +---+---+---+
 | M : P : G |
 +---+---+---+
 Functions:
 "Look" function (This will be to see what is in the room)
  Move function
  Make a menu. #
  Make a player definition sequence. [PDS] (gender, hair color, has mullet, eye color, weirdness factor, other things that are useable but never used or are) #

  Phase 2:
  
  Map:
  +---+---+---+
  | N : N : N |
  +-:-+-:-+-:-+
  | P | M | G |
  +---+---+---+
  Functions:
  Chance Battle & Reatreat (with messages telling of player adjectives defined in the player definition sequence)

  Phase 3:

  Map:
  +---+---+---+
  | M : P | G |
  +-:-+-:-+-:-+
  | C : N | M |
  +---+-:-+-:-+
  | M : C : M |
  +---+---+---+ 
  Functions:
  Equipment
  Investigate (Find items or traps)

  Phase 4:

  Improve, change, or create another adventure in a different genre

  Documentation:

    Game.java:
  Not much to see there, just the calling and running of the game, but nothing too complicated other than the player definition sequence.

    Room.java:
  Really complicated, it basically is a database of each room's information, all completely made by me, and has a function the finds what room your in and displays all of the options in a playable way. It also contains the basic win/lose functions.

    Entity and its subclasses (child classes)
  They contain every entity in the game, including the player. Also determins the looks, quotes, health, and chances of every enemy.
